Attached is a PDF 'AEO Scoring.pdf'.

This is an assessment generated by a commercial tool evaluating a company's positioning for answer engine optimization. This is the AI equivalent of SEO. Task outlined below, you just need to create a simple proof of concept. Again to emphasize - Because we are still at the interview stage I do not expect you to spend too much time on this. Produce what you can in enough time to demonstrate your skill, that will be sufficient. Use any AI tools you want - Cursor, Claude, Codex etc.

Objective Create a small command-line or browser-based utility that, given a brand name (e.g., Martus Solutions), produces a simple “AEO snapshot” inspired by the attached report. The tool should generate or retrieve:

- A lightweight, AI-assisted AEO-style score

- A structured summary covering:
  - Brand recognition
  - Market competition
  - Sentiment
  - Strengths & weaknesses
  - Opportunities & threats

Notes & Expectations

- This is intentionally open-ended. Some candidates may build a very small prototype; others may expand further depending on time and motivation.
- You are encouraged to use coding agents and other AI coding tools—the task should not require a heavy time investment if you work effectively with them.
- The goal is not score accuracy but to see how you:
  - Translate an ambiguous brief into a functioning tool
  - Use LLMs for both code generation and data synthesis
  - Make practical engineering decisions (formatting, structure, modularity, handling messy outputs)
  - Communicate your reasoning and thought process

Choose whatever tech stack, design, or interface lets you move fastest. A short README explaining what you built, why, and what you’d improve is appreciated but not required.
